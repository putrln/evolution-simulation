# Project 1: Animal Evolution Simulation

## Description:
This project simulates the evolution of animals on a two-dimensional map with grass. Animals move around the map, consume grass, and reproduce. The simulation allows users to observe changes in animal populations and their genotypes over time.

## Key Features:
- **Map**: Divided into two zones - jungle and savannah. Each tile can contain grass and any number of animals.
- **Animals**: Each animal has its unique genotype, energy level, and orientation. They can move, eat grass, and reproduce.
- **Grass**: Grows randomly on the map. Animals can consume it to increase their energy.

## User Interface:
Users can initiate the simulation and then observe its progress in the application window. The simulation provides insights into the number of animals, their average energy, the amount of grass on the map, and other significant statistics.

## Technology:
The project was developed using Java and leverages the JavaFX library for its graphical user interface.
